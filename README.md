# Movie-Search-Engine-ReactNative
This project is a movie details search engine, it is coded in JavaScript with the using of the React Native framework under 3 hours for a job technical test.

### Detailed description
User is able to find the details of a specific movie through this application platform.
An API wasn't able to work on that time of test, hence I have created some mock data to present this project.

### Example:
<img src="https://github.com/ren-tao01/Movie-Search-Engine-ReactNative/blob/main/assets/images/movie_search.PNG" alt="Your image title" width="400"/>
